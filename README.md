# Machine Learning portfolio

Hi there, this is a small collection of my machine learning portfolio which I embarked on as a personal hobby. Hope you enjoyed it!

Projects:
1. Predicting bike rental usage based on weather - SVM and RFR (supervised learning)
2. Predicting the outcome of a cancer patient - Logistic regression & Gradient boost (supervised learning)
3. Segmenting customers into 4 groups based on E-commerce data - KMeans clustering (unsupervised learning)
4. Attempting to predict whether someone will repay a loan given certain criterias - Decision trees (supervised learning)
5. Supermarket sales analysis - Data visualisation
